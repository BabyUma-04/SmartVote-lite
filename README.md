**Blockchain-Based Voting System with AI Anomaly Detection**  
Final Year Project – CSE (Anna University)

---

## Objective
To design and implement a secure blockchain-based voting system and integrate an AI-based anomaly detection model to identify suspicious voting behavior such as vote duplication and sudden vote spikes.

---

## Features
- Blockchain-based vote storage for transparency and security
- AI-based anomaly detection using Isolation Forest to detect suspicious spikes
- Pattern-based pre-generated voting simulation
- Real-time live vote input for demonstration
- Graphical representation of suspicious spikes by region
- Full blockchain display for auditability

---

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Blockchain (SHA-256 hashing)
- Machine Learning: Isolation Forest
- Pandas (Data Processing)
- Matplotlib (Graphical Representation)

---

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open `SmartVote_Lite_Final.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run all cells in order from top to bottom:
   - Phase 1: Pre-generated votes with anomaly detection
   - Phase 2: Live vote input demonstration
4. Observe tables and graphical outputs for suspicious votes
5. Optional: Display full blockchain for verification
